# 🌦️ Weather Prediction Model

This repository contains a machine learning-based weather prediction model developed using historical weather data. The model leverages supervised learning techniques to forecast future weather conditions such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

## 📂 Project Structure

- `weather-predicting-model.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with the complete implementation of the weather prediction pipeline, including:
  - Data loading and preprocessing
  - Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Model training and evaluation
  - Forecasting and visualization of predictions

## 📌 Features

- 📊 Data cleaning and normalization for better model performance
- 📈 Visualization of trends and relationships in the weather dataset
- 🤖 Implementation of different ML models (e.g., Linear Regression, Decision Trees)
- 🧪 Model evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R² Score
- 📉 Forecasting future weather variables

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Kimanidavid/Weather-prediction-model-.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Weather-prediction-model-
   ```

3. Install required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   *(Note: You may need to manually create a `requirements.txt` or install the libraries used in the notebook individually.)*

4. Run the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook weather-predicting-model.ipynb
   ```

## 📊 Sample Outputs

The notebook includes visualizations such as:
- Temperature and humidity trends over time
- Prediction vs. actual plots
- Feature importance graphs
